Invite Flow: POST /api/admins/:id/invite returns token & link (demo).

Audit Log: store {actorId, action, targetId, timestamp} in local JSON/localStorage. Display in /admin/audit.

Impersonation (optional demo): Super Admin can impersonate another user (show audit).

Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions; toasts for success/errors.

API STUBS & ROUTES (demo serverless / local JSON)

POST /api/auth/login → returns { token, user } with role

POST /api/auth/logout → invalidates token (demo)

GET /api/admins → list users (role-protected)

POST /api/admins → create user (role-protected)

PUT /api/admins/:id → update user (role-protected)

DELETE /api/admins/:id → deactivate/delete (Super Admin only)
